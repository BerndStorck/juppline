# juppline

This is an older, very simple script, I've written for supporting work with the text editor jupp, which is a branch of the editor joe.

Like with many other editors you might open a file with jupp and jump immediately to a specific line number, but you can not give jupp a word for searching this in the file to open and for jumping directly to the first line with this word.

This is where juppline helps. It finds the line number with the first occurrence of the searched word and opens the file with jupp jumping directly to that line.

I've written this several years ago, and because of the simplicity of the task and the shortness of this script, I see no need for optimizations like replacing cut by Bash internals or other things.

## Usage

Give the following command for short help:

juppline --help

Or for German help:

juppline --hilf
