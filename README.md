# juppline

This is a simple script that I wrote to support work with the text editor Jupp, which is a fork of the editor Joe.

Like many other editors, you can open a file with Jupp and jump immediately to a specific line number. However, Jupp does not allow you to search for a word in the file and directly jump to the first line containing that word.

This is where Juppline comes in. It finds the line number of the first occurrence of the searched word and opens the file with Jupp, jumping directly to that line.

I wrote this several years ago, and I have now (in 2024) optimized the script again after a long time to improve its efficiency. I have adapted and modernized some functions without losing the original simplicity and functionality of the script.
